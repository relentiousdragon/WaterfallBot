By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect and process the following types of information to provide and improve the Bot's services.

    *   `language`: The preferred language for bot responses and logs.
    *   `logs`: Configuration for logging various server events, including channel IDs and webhooks.
    *   `warnThresholds`: Custom warning thresholds set by moderators.
    *   **Bot Detection Settings:** Configuration for automatic bot protection.

**b. Information Collected Automatically:**

*   **User Data:**
    *   `userID`: Your unique Discord ID.
    *   `locale`: Your preferred language/locale (e.g., "en", "it").
    *   `lastActive`: Timestamp of your last interaction.

    *   **Global User Infractions:** Aggregated records of infractions across eligible community servers to identify repeat offenders or malicious bots.
    *   **Bot Detection Tracking:** Temporary tracking of recently joined suspected spam/bot user's activity (message frequency, link/mention counts) for up to 2 hours to prevent spam.
*   **Server Statistics (Analytics):**
    *   If enabled, we track anonymized message activity (date, channel ID, user ID) and voice session durations. Detailed activity logs are typically retained for 30-60 days.

**c. Third-Party Integrations:**

When you use certain commands, Waterfall interacts with third-party providers. We only share the minimum data necessary for these services to function:

*   **Google Gemini (AI):** Prompts, usernames, and a sample of server emojis may be sent to Google to provide AI responses.
*   **Search Engines (SerpApi):** Search queries are sent to providers like Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, or DuckDuckGo to retrieve results.
*   **Wolfram Alpha:** Computational queries are sent to Wolfram Alpha.
*   **External Meta-Data:** We may perform lookups for GitHub repositories, Minecraft servers, OMDb (Movies/Shows/Games), or Wikipedia based on your input.

**d. Aggregated and Analytical Data:**

*   We collect anonymous, aggregated data to monitor usage:
    *   `commandsUsage`: Count of command executions.
    *   `messages` and `interactions`: Total volume of activity.
    *   Win counts for game commands (RPS, Connect4).
